Nota single cloud in the sky. About 70degrees.11:55 I decide that we re going to kickthe shit outof Nebraska.11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan togo fuckhimself.12:15 The UT band walks by on the wayto theAlamodome. We re on the second floor ofa two-storyparking garage on the corner (a couplehundred of us).We re hooting and hollering likewildmen. The banddoubles back to the street right belowus andserenades us with Texas Fight and TheEyes of Texas.AWESOME MOMENT.12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,50-100 grownmen are bumping chests with oneanother, each andevery one of them now secure andcertain of the factthat we are going to kick theshit out of Nebraska.1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on theway to theAlamodome. Again, we hoot and hollerlike wildmen.Again, the band doubles back and stopsright below usto serenade us, this time, however,with the Nebraskafight songs. Although somewhatimpressed by theirspirit and verve, we remain convincedthat we aregoing to kick the shit out ofNebraska.1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,somehowmanaging to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11cans of beerinto my pants.1:47 I am in line surrounded byNebraska fans. Theyare taunting me. I am taunting back,still certainthat we are going to kick theshit out of Nebraska. Idecide to challenge a particularlyvocal Nebraska fanto play what I now call and willforever be rememberedas ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flopout for adollar? The rules are similar. I tellthis Nebraskajackass that if he s so confident inhis team, heshould ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHTNOW and makeplane reservations to Phoenix for theFiesta Bowl.And then I spoke these memorable words:""And notthosedamn refundable tickets, either! Yourequest thosenon-refundable, non-transferrablesons-of-bitches!""He backs down. He is unworthy. I callSouthwestAirlines and buy two tickets toPhoenix,non-refundableand non-transferrable. Price: $712. Heis humbled.He lowers his head in shame. I raise mycell phone intriumph to the cheers of hundreds ofTexas fans. I amKING and these are my subjects. Idistribute the 11beers in my pants to the cheeringmasses. I RULE thepre-game kingdom.2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,I open theTraveler and pour my first stiffy.2:45 I notice something troubling:Nebraska is big.Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is verypissed off atTexas.3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.9 yardstotal offense for Texas. Zero firstdowns for Texas.I m still talking shit. I pouranother stiffy fromthe Traveler.3:36 Four minutes to go in the firsthalf: theTraveler is a dead soldier. I buy myfirst $5 beerfrom the Alamodome merchants. While Iam standing inline, a center snap nearly decapitatesMajorApplewhiteand rolls out of the end zone. Safety.3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas0. I wish Ihad another Traveler.4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraskafan in thebathroom at halftime, I attempt torevive the classicBrice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:""Hey, buddy,niiiiiiiiice cock."" He isunamused.4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer fromthe Alamodomemerchants. I share my beer with twohigh school girlssitting behind me. Surprisingly, theyare equippedwith a flask full of vodka. I send themoff topurchase $5 Sprites, so that we mayconsume theirvodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraskais a bunch ofpussies.4:51 No more vodka. The girls sittingbehind me havefled for their lives. I purchase twomore $5 beersfrom the Alamodome merchants.5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. Iam beginningto lose faith. This normally wouldtrouble me, but Iam too drunk to see the football field.5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I msorry, sir.Those tickets have been confirmed andarenon-refundable and non-transferrable.""5:37 I try to start a fight with everyperson behindthe concession counter. As it turnsout, theAlamodome has a policy that no beer canbe sold whenthere is less than 10 minutes on thegame clock. I amenraged by this policy. I ask loudly:""Why the fuckdidn t you announce last call over thefucking PAsystem??!!""5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped inmy chair indefeat. All of a sudden, the Texascrowd goesabsolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,awaking frommy coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""Alas, theanswer is no, we were not winning andwe did notscore.The largest (by far) cheer of the dayfrom the Texasfaithful occurred when the handlerswere walking backto the tunnel and Bevo stopped to takea gargantuanshit all over the letters ""S"",""K"", and ""A"" in the""Nebraska"" spelled out in their endzone. I cheerwildly. I pick up the empty Travelerbottle and stickmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk asI walk backto the truck. I would taunt them withsome off-colorremarks about their parentage, but I amtoo drunk toform complete sentences. With my lastcognitivethought of the evening, I take solacein the fact thatif we had not beaten them in October,they would beplaying Florida State for the nationalchampionship.6:30 Back in the car. On the way backto Austin forthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We canstill salvagethe day! I crack open a beer. It iswarm. I don tcare.7:12 We have stopped for gas. I amhungry. I goinside the store. I walk past the beerfrig. Inotice a Zima. I ve never had a Zima. Iwonder ifit s any good. I pull a Zima from thefrig. I twistthe top off and drink the Zima in threeswallows.Zimasucks. I replace the empty bottle inthe frig.7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in thestore. I walk towhere the ingredients are, where theperson usuallymakes the sub. There is no one there. Ilean overthe counter and scoop out half a bucketof blackolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.I leanfurther over the counter and grabapproximately twopounds of Pastrami. I walk out of thestoregrunting and eating Pastrami. Thepatrons in thestore fear me. I don t care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I havebeen drinkingwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunntunes for overan hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. Hesuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunnhave writtenother good songs besides ""You re Goingto Miss Me WhenI m Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and thatmaybe listening toonly those two songs, ten times eachwas a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, Icould just let theCD play on its own. I tell him tofuck off andrestart ""Neon Moon.""8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. Mytruckmate,against my loud and profaneprotestations, parks onthe top floor of a nearby parkinggarage. I tell himhe s an idiot. I tell him we will neverget out. Itell him we may as well pitch afucking tent here. Heignores me. I think he s still pissedabout theBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""NeonMoon"" loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beersstuffed inmy pants. We re going to kick theshit out ofArizona.9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona29. I ampleased. I go to the bathroom to peefor the 67thtime today. I giggle to myself becauseof thenew opportunity to do ""the bathroomBrice."" There areno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I amdisappointed.I tell myself (out loud) that I have a""Niiiiiicecock."" No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom whiledrinking Bud Lightout of a can. Needless to say, they donot sell beerat the Erwin Center, much less BudLight out of a can.I am stopped by an usher: ""Where didyou getthat, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):""Oh, thecheerleaders were throwing them up withthose littleplastic footballs. Would you mindthrowing this awayfor me?"" I take the last swig and handit to him. Heis confused. I pretend I m going to thebathroom, butI run away giggling instead. I duckinto someentrance to avoid the usher, who is nowpursuing me.I sneak into a large group of peopleand sit down.Theusher walks by harmlessly. I amgiggling like a littlegirl. I crack open another can of BudLight.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoidthe usher, Ihave lost my bearings. I have no ticketstub. Icannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by therefs. I amenraged. I have cleared out the seatsaround mebecause I keep removing my hat andbeating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concernedfan asks ifI m OK and perhaps I shouldn t take itso seriously.I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive""worst fuckingcall I have EVER seen,"" I attempt toremove my hatagain to begin beating inanimateobjects. However, onthis occasion I miscalculate and Ithumbnail myself inmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarterinch gash overmy eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and allover my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think tomyself, ""I mtaking this a bit seriously.""10:22 I am standing in the bathroompeeing. I m sodrunk I am swaying and grunting. I havea bloodynapkin pressed on my left eye.

However the fact remains that fundamentals have changed little in the past month with the same supply issues which served to tighten this mkt over the last eight weeks continuing to keep a firm hold on the market throughout Q4 and Q1 2001. Indeed with the ocean frt market still steeply inverted for the winter versusthe rest of the year ( $11 versus $9.50 RBCT/ARA) and with the U.S mkt experiencing a massive squeeze front end (east coasttrading $35 fob barge) there is little sign of relief in the short term - Q1 2001 Fob ARA is now trading close to $44 with Jan/Dec2001 around $43.25. Producers will of course lead us to believe that the origin markets are structured in a steep contango forthe remainder of the year, however leaving the issue of mkt consolidation aside there is little in the mkt to justify this - if anythingdemand in the Far East looks a little shakier with steel orders slowing down and the financial markets under pressure and forecastsfor European demand estimate unchanged demand year on year. While a marked sell off for second half of the year is unlikely wesee the forward curve on the fob origin side flat going forward rather than contango. This said we cannot preclude a shift higherof absolute prices for the whole curve from where we are today at around $33 Fob South Africa equivalent to $35 - there is stillplenty of business to be done for 2001 and my feeling is that consumers will end up buying into it rather than risk the wait andsee game - we cannot underestimate the influence on international prices that the cartel hold and even if this is exaggeratedit s implication is enuff to create a bullish psychology.SPOT TRADES 150,000mt of Pinang quality from KPC for Dec shipment at $27.60 Fob Indo basis 6000 kcal/kg160,000mt of Prima  quality from KPC for Nov shipment at $30.15 Fob Indo basis 6400 kcal/kg150,000mt option of Prima quality from KPC - to be shipped latest end June at $30.65 Fob Indo basis 6400 kcal/kg.2 x 150,000mt Put Options from TXU for April/Sep and Oct/Mar 02 respectively.

Dyckerhoff - offered 4 x 15,000mt of generic South Africa material for April/November delivery at $43.50 fob barge.BUYING SIDEDuiker - Have put various structures in front of Duiker which involves us buying a cape a quarter for 2001 - they are due to getback to us within the next few days.Drummond - offered us a 5 year deal staring in 2002 at $35 Fob Colombia - thanks!!Krutrade - working numbers to put an aggressive multi-year offer in front of Krutrade as they seem to be the movers in the Russianmkt at present - we must establish a decent source of Russian coal within our portfolio to service our Bremen and Bewag businessgoing forward.Anker - talking with them re securing south african stem out of Maputo for 2001 - they are looking at somewhere around the $27 fobMaputo level.Masefield - currently in talks with them to secure some tonnage out of Santa Marta for 2001.Coal Procurement - talking about securing a hdymax shipment per quarter out of Durban for 2001Currently working with U.S. on finalising numbers for Synfuel supplies for 2001 but currently remain $0.75 - $1.00 apart.We currently have some 50mmt of Colombian coal sitting on the ground in Amsterdan/Rotterdam to sell as fillers into backendof the year and we have the M.V. Cleopatra Dream arriving in Rotterdam on Nov 26 with 143mmt of Australian coal to sell intothe mkt.EOLMuch of the talk at Coaltrans centred around the press release from GlobalCoal of the intention of the Cartel plus Rio to launch an e-platform which will provide mkts against 3 Fob origin points and an ARA delivery point. Details of operational functionalityare scarce and increasingly it looks like this is explained by fact that they themselves do not know but general consensus reckonsit will be operational end of first quarter 01. Rather than see this as competition, if successful it could provide us with more accessto markets than we have previously had and there shud be some fun and games to be had with the various producers.  Total volumes for EOL to date are at 1,700,000mt. We have seen a lot of interest in our options which in not surprising given current mkt conditions as consumers look to hedge themselves with cheap out of the money options. As volatility increases other non-traditional coal players are also entering the mkt to utilise the opportunities which increasingly volatility presents. Next project is to get quotes in Euros andafter that we will begin to look at spark spreads via EOL.GAMEPLANWe had a major cuppla weeks on the buying side prior to Coaltrans - 75% of which is owned through optionality out of RBCT at between$30 and $31.50. Additional avenues into South Africa through Maputo and Durban now means that we have a decent portfolio of SouthAfrican material to add to our Colombian long. Overall our position is some 2.5 million mt long including the latest Indonesian purchases -our efforts now are focused on securing some of the term business which is out there at current numbers - it is difficult to call this mktin either direction with any certainty and hence we are busy covering any downside potential with a host of put options which the utilitiesare keen to mkt in this bullish enviroment. After weeks of writing that we need to add other origins to our long portfolio we look in far bettershape today with good prospects to add further flexibility in terms of diversity of origins which ultimately reduces our reliance on Drummond.While the mkt in general is still seemingly unable to grasp the true value of an option we will continue to exploit this chink by owning asmuch flexibility as possible thru physical put and call options.Best RegardsJez', 'innappropriate');

Okay, enough of my lecturing (I ve just been caught in a couple of si=tuations at work where someone decides to confess their feelings to me and =I m forced to tell them I just don t feel the same way...something that s h=ard for them to grasp given the fact that some flirting at some point did o=ccur).Well, I m off to Vegas this weekend.

I am enraged by thispolicy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn t you announce last call over thefucking PA system??!!"5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat.

I don t care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singingBrooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other goodsongs besides "You re Going to Miss Me When I m Gone" and "Neon Moon" andthat maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud andprofane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.Itell him he s an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we mayas well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he s still pissedabout the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We re going tokick the shit out of Arizona.9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to thebathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of thenew opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in thebathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needlessto say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light outofa can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those littleplastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take thelast swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I m going to thebathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance toavoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group ofpeople and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like alittle girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. Ihave no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared outthe seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I m OK and perhaps Ishouldn t take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," Iattempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I m taking this abit seriously."10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I m so drunk I am swaying andgrunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants arebloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I looklike I should be in an episode of Cops.10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and makemy way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a goodsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but Imerely grunt incoherently and keep moving.10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up sixflights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in theface for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, andcollapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, andno one is moving. I take a nap.11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver s seat. I lift myhead to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined upall the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  Iam too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, andno one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bedof the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the secondfloor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at melike I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on thefront of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go fromvehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return tomy vehicle.12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to myapartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle ofGlenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to dietonight.12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decideit would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther s. Ed has to pee.He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  Wegiggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther s.1:17 The PollyEsther s doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enterhis club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I ve been working this door for almost a year. I ve been working doors in thistown for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain t never seenthree drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can t let you in." Weattempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn tthat fuckin  hard. Day don t fuckin  do that at the Awamo...the awaom...thealab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequilaand three beers.2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two andone half blocks to Katz s. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tellhim to keep it.2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seatedimmediately.2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, twoorders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheesestuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. Thewaiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of therestaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don t give a fuck. The tab is$112 with tip.2:46 I m sleepy.9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz s.She is not pretty.> >> - att1.htm', 'innappropriate');
